# Project
- Name: Event Attendee Demographics
- Story: The goal is to paint a picture of event demographis and ticket buyers.  Data should show event sponsors the value of sponsoring an event.
- Stakeholder: Sean Sullivan from ME Trust for Local News.
- Get a working Prototype so the METLN can quickly visualize and share with their clients breakdowns of who is attending events, if they are donating, how far out they are purchasing tickets so that campaigns can be targeted. 

# Team
- Maddison Jordan & Erin Pryor
- Github Repo: https://github.com/nudataviz/project-fall25-Jordan-NE.git


# Data
- Dataset contains ticketing data for various events tied to specific customers.
- Link to dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_HXIUxgKPk8Gce9CANVhgAgQO2u4mlB
- Risks: Small data set may not paint an entire picture- may not be scalable if we only have access to a few events
