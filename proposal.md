title: Rough Project Proposal

# Project
- Name: Event Attendee Demographics
- Story: The goal is to paint a picture of event demographis and ticket buyers.  Data should show event sponsors the value of sponsoring an event.
- Stakeholder: Sean Sullivan from ME Trust for Local News.

# Team
- Members: Maybe Erin Pryor?  Meeting on the books with her and the stakeholder next week.
- Github Repo: https://github.com/nudataviz/project-fall25-Jordan-NE.git

# Data
- Dataset contains ticketing data for various events tied to specific customers.
- Link to dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_HXIUxgKPk8Gce9CANVhgAgQO2u4mlB
- Risks: They included several visuals which do not seem to be replicable using the data (they contain other info as well). Unclear if that data will be forthcoming.  Also, their project request may be beyond the scope of the data visualization class.
